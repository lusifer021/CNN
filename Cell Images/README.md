# Classifying Real Cell Images

Implemented CNN using Tensorflow, in this project to classify real cell images into infected and uninfected cells.
Used ImageDataGenerator to increase the dataset, by rotating, croping and zooming; this helped in obtaining better results
The model gave a 86% percent macro average f1 score.
